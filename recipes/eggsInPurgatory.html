        <p>These baked eggs in tomato are a fun take on shaksuka that's as great for breakfast as it is for dinner.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
                <li>5 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
                <li>Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>20 oz. cherry tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 bunch Swiss chard</li>
                <li>6 large eggs</li>
                <li>4 thin slices of country-style bread</li>
                <li>1 lemon</li>
                <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
                <li>Handful of basil leaves</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a medium skillet over medium-high. When oil is starting to shimmer, add garlic and season generously with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is just turning golden around the edges, about a minute. Stir in red pepper flakes, then add tomatoes and cook, tossing occassionally, until tomatoes look plumped and some of the skins start to split, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium. Cover pan and cook, stirring tomatoes every couple minutes and lightly smashing them with a wooden spoon to encourage them to release some juices, until mixture is saucy and tomatoes are slightly deflated but still hold some shape. Five to seven minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, strip leaves off of the Swiss chard, and tear into bite size pieces (or larger, if desired.) Transfer leaves to a medium bowl, and reserve stems for future use.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat under tomatoes to medium-low (sauce should be bubbling gently.) Carefully crack eggs into a large measuring glass, then slip one at a time into tomato mixture, spacing them evenly around the perimeter of the pan. Season eggs with salt and pepper, cover pan, and cook until whites are set, but yolks are still runny. Four to six minutes.</li>
                <li>Squeeze about 2 tbsp. lemon juice over greens, then toss in basil. Drizzle some oil over and season with salt and black pepper. Toss again to combine</li>
                <li>Scoop an egg out of the pan, spooning it up from underneath to keep the yolk intact, and transfer to a small bowl. Spoon extra sauce around egg and garnish with flaky salt. Serve along side the Swiss chard and basil salad with a piece of toast.</li>
                <li><strong>DO AHEAD: </strong>Tomato mixture can be made one day ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat over medium until simmering before adding the eggs.</li>
            </ol>
